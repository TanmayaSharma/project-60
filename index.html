        <p class="h1">Programming is a rewarding career as well as an engaging hobby for developers. If you keep the approach to programming as a hobby than a job, you will sharpen your skills in a practical way. It can also be a fantastic way to master any new programming language,I personaly found coding and programming very interesting ! You can try coding at various platforms and I always be curious that what will happen next in the class and don't forget to do the projects :)
